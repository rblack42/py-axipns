    base class for megawidgets within a frame
"""

description = """
    This class creates a megawidget contained within a tkinter.Frame
    window.  The class acts as the base class for megawidgets that are
    not contained in their own toplevel window, such as ~ButtonBox~ and
    ~ComboBox~.  It creates a tkinter.Frame component, named *hull*,
    to act as the container of the megawidget.  The window class name
    for the *hull* widget is set to the most-specific class name for
    the megawidget.  Derived classes specialise this class by
    creating other widget components as children of the *hull* widget.
