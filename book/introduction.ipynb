    "Hopefully, like me, you are fascinated by flight and want to understand what makes it possible. That idea has been a part of human history for as long as people watched bird-like critters navigate the sky. How in the world do they do that? We might have been fascinated by flying insects, but we usually just want to swat those things!\n",

    "I grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, and at about age three, I was introduced to the Smithsonian Institute. I was born a couple of years before Dr. Paul Garber, Curator Emeritus of the Air and Space Museum, brought the *Wright Flyer* back from England to be displayed there. Right behind that machine, the *Spirit of St. Louis* also hung. \n",
    "\n",
    "My tour guide back then was Andy Tarapchak, my childhood next-door neighbor and a B-26 pilot who flew over 70 missions over France and Germany during WWII! I suspect those visits lit the spark that started me on my own quest to figure out flight.\n",

    "When the idea of flying struck humans, the best thing they could think to do was build a machine and jump off a cliff! Not very smart, but what else could you do? Perhaps just make the cliff short!\n",

It is powered by a rubber band and has the potential to fly in a large audotorium for around 10 minutes. It cruises at a staggering 4 miles per hour!\n",

    "Obviously, building models like this one is a very expensive operation, and you really want to be sure the design is sound before committing to this!\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind tunnels have one big advantage, though. They use real air and blast it past the model at very high speeds giving us a very good way to figure out how the \"real\" airplane will fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is if we can figure out how to measure things. If you look closely, there are many probes mounted on this model in front of the left engine nacelle. These will be used measure some of the properties of the air moving by the model. This \"experimental\" data is vital in our work, especially when we try to develop new methods for predicting how a design will fly!\n"

(I even learned t fly over that same field - cool!)\n",

In fact this lady though up the idea of using cards from the Jacard Loom. a recent invention tsking the textime industry by storm at the time. Tha lady, Aada Agusta Lovelace, is therefore credited with inventing the idea of a \"programmable calculating machine\". I worked on tha Department of Defense project to build a new programming langiage named in her honoer. Ada was to be apowerful language, but it never caught on. Another upstart language that came out about the same time swept it away: C++ - ever heard of that one?\n",

The Curta Calculator could add, sibtract multiply and divide and produced 11 digits of accuracy. I bought mine while studying Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech when my evil professors asked for more accuracy than I could get from my trusty side rule. It cost $250 in 1966, but is worth several thousand dollars today!\n",
